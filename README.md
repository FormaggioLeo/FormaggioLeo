<h1>Hi! I'm Leonardo Formaggio</h1>
<h2>But you can call me just <strong>Leo</strong> or just <strong>Formaggio</strong>.</h2>
<p>🎓 I'm student of System Analysis and Development on Descomplica University, Brazil.</br>
💻 I'm a full-stack developer studying to know more about it and knowing other development areas even more different or like this maybe, why not?</br>
🌎 Furthermore, I speak any languages as Native Portuguese, fluent Spanish, intermediate English and a bit of Italian.</br>
😁 Yeah, I really love the idea of knowing more about the world, people, culture and their languages.</br>
❗Oh, and I teach Spanish too.</p>
